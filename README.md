### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Ethan Himmell, and Computer Science is my passion. I taught myself Java in Middle School and ever since, one of my favorite hobbies has been to create projects, both fun and applicable, to utilize new skills I've learned or new technologies I've been working with.

My background includes fluency in Java, JavaScript, Python, and SalesForce Apex. More recently, I've been learning about React, TensorFlow, Pytorch, and general AI Model Training. I've made sure to put these skills to good use through projects like infoS&P, a stock market learning website that uses AI predictions to help users learn patterns and trends in the market. You can check it out here: learn.infosandp.com

Right now, I'm improving my skills through a combination of new projects and LeetCode. I started LeetCoding only recently, but I already enjoy the ability to write algorithms that reinforce the concept of creation from intuition as well as teach me new skills to use on future problems. I strive to complete 2-3 new exercises every day, which you can find my solutions to on my linked LeetCode profile. As far as AI goes, I'm involved in some exciting new startups and am pursuing a certification in AI Engineering through IBM.

Most days, you'll find me either at work or coding away on new projects. I have a busy schedule, but I work hard to balance it out through hanging out with friends and some of my more recreational hobbies like fishing, golf, or legos.

Looking to contact me or collaborate? You can reach me through my LinkedIn profile or my email, himmellethan@gmail.com. Hope to hear from you soon!

-Ethan
