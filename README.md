### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Ethan Himmell, and Computer Science is my passion. I taught myself Java in Middle School and ever since, one of my favorite hobbies has been to create projects, both fun and applicable, to utilize new skills I've learned or new technologies I've been working with.

My background includes fluency in Java, JavaScript, Python, and SalesForce Apex. More recently, I've been learning about React, TensorFlow, Pytorch, and general AI Model Training. I've made sure to put these skills to good use through projects like infoS&P, a stock market learning website that uses AI predictions to help users learn patterns and trends in the market.  check out the first version here: http://learn.infosandp.com

Most days, you'll find me either at work or coding away on new projects. I have a busy schedule, but I work hard to balance it out through hanging out with friends and some of my more recreational hobbies like fishing, golf, or legos.

Looking to contact me or collaborate? You can reach me through my LinkedIn profile or my email, himmellethan@gmail.com. Hope to hear from you soon!

-Ethan
