### Ethan Himmell

Hi, I'm Ethan, a student at Purdue University studying Artificial Intelligence under the Department of Computer Science. I'm also a returning Software/Data Engineering intern at State Farm and an undergraduate ML+DS researcher at Purdue's Data Mine in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories.

I'm interested in all things Computer Science related. I work with Machine Learning tech like PyTorch, TensorFlow, pandas, numpy, and other DS libraries frequently and am familiar with frontend tech like HTML/CSS/JS, React, and Angular, as well as backend resources such as Django, Flask, Express, and Springboot. I'm also a big Leetcoder and know a lot about common algorithms.

I've worked on a few cool projects, like my 2023 State Farm Hack Day winner bike-tastrophe. Made in collaboration with other State Farm interns, it's an Android App designed to help identify if the user has been in a bike crash and alert authorities. I've also been focused on a contributing to a new system that predicts the destinations of in air flights that is a joint project between Purdue's Data Mine and Sandia National labs.

When I'm not coding, I like building things like Legos, golfing, fishing, working out, cooking, hanging out with friends, and more. I strive to create a healthy balance between studies and fun that promotes an interest in both areas.

If you want to reach me, feel free to send me an email at ehimmell@purdue.edu. I'm open to projects, work opportunities, research, and pretty much everything else CS related. I look forward to hearing from you.
