### Ethan Himmell

Hi, I'm Ethan, a student at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign studying Computer Science and Philosophy. I love coding, AI, and making cool projects that showcase my interests and help me grow.

I have worked at State Farm as a Software Engineer Intern for three summers, and spent a semester as an undergraduate researcher in a joint AI project between Purdue University, where I spent the first year of my undergrad, and Sandia National Labs that aimed to predict irregularities in the destinations of in air flights.

When I'm not working on technical related things, I like to spend my time fishing, hiking, cooking, hanging out with friends, or playing video games.

If you have a cool project idea you think I'd like, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out at himmellethan@gmail.com.
